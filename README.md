# Interpaws Demo

This project showcases a veterinary clinic scheduling backend built with **Flask**.
It includes a small HTML interface and uses SQLite for persistence.

## Running with Docker

Build and start the backend service:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

The container seeds a demo database and launches the Flask app on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
